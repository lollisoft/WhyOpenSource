# WhyOpenSource

This is a trial to start a public article about why I have started my main open source project.

Go [here](https://lollisoft.github.io/WhyOpenSource/WhyOpenSource.md/WhyOpenSource.html) to read why I have started creating an open source project.

Go [here for splitted documents](https://lollisoft.github.io/WhyOpenSource/WhyOpenSource.md/index.html) to read why I have started creating an open source project.

The writing process is based upon [Ron Jeffries Scriv Git Pages](https://github.com/RonJeffries/scriv-git-pages) project. I have adopted it to my needs and would thank you Ron!
