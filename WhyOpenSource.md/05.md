# The professionals use SAA #

Later, when I tried to market Dateiver as a shareware version, I got told that this application would not win a price. It was lacking a modern UI and thus the software dealer I contacted, was not appealed about it to put that in his store. I learned that as well with my customer and there seems to be more than this one picky customer not wanting to work on console. The shareware seller told me that I could have a look at that fancy SAA UI and I did so and learned.

I had to buy another compiler version and needed to migrate my software from Turbo Pascal 5.5 to 6.0 to be able to utilize that new fancy SAA UI toolkit.
