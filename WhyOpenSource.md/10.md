# Starting to learn databases #

After a while using Watcom 10.6 and MFC I got notice of a much fancier development tool than Watcom. It was Power++ from Powersoft. Powersoft purchased Watcom and it’s compiler tools and database stuff I didn’t were aware of yet.

The marketing of Power++ appealed me to look into that tool - as it included my next journey to learn databases within that tool and claimed to be RAD and I could get ready with my application fast.
