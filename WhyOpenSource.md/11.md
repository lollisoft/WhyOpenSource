# I began porting Train #

When I have purchased Power++ Developer - the smallest version I was capable of buying at that time, I started porting my application I was developing for the club to use the Power++ class library. While doing this I added more time into building my sophisticated diagramming stuff than database, I can now say, I have neglected one of my biggest issue in my career as a professional software developer - I still wasn’t professional.

The diagramming capabilities were interesting, because I have done my own interpreter to let the user design it’s own symbols. While doing so, the stuff was stored within a database and I even had some simple customer entries in my table.
