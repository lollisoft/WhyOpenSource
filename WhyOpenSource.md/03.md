# My first software ideas #

As soon as I had Turbo Pascal I also had my first ideas for a software. While my education, I had collected many diskettes and it seemed to be complicated to keep notes on paper or only on the stickers to know, what is on these diskettes.

I started to write ‚dateiver‘ - a disk cataloging system. It had only a command line UI. Even today there exists many command line tools and on Linux there are many that also work together and are very helpful. But my application was a standalone application not designed to work with other applications together.

As you may notice, the folder is named differently. At that time I didn’t structure my source code well and that leads to struggle as well. Dateiver was copied over for a new application - Tvvt.

At that time I also learned much about programming data structures and I needed them in my disk cataloging system. Databases where not known to me at that time - I would have not learned data structures so early. Also I learned how to store and load the collected data and also to traverse a file system to read in the data from a disk.
