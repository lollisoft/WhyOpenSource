As I told, I had purchased my first computer at or short before my education, I quickly stumbled upon an object oriented language. It appealed me more than Basic and I did my next purchase. In my education, Basic was the language we learned and I was most of the time ready before the rest. That was probably because I learned Basic on the C64 and it was similar to GWBasic I think it was.
