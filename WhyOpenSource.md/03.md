# Starting with programming #

As I told, I had purchased my first computer at or short before my education, I quickly stumbled upon an object oriented language. It appealed me more than Basic and I did my next purchase. In my education, Basic was the language we learned and I was most of the time ready before the rest. That was probably because I learned Basic on the C64 and it was similar to GWBasic I think it was.

Later, when I tried to market that software as a shareware version, I got told that this application would not win a price. It was lacking a modern UI and thus the software dealer I contacted, was not appealed about it to put that in his store.

I had to buy another compiler version and needed to migrate my software from Turbo Pascal 5.5 to 6.0 to be able to utilize that new fancy SAA UI toolkit.
