# Default Formatting #

Default Formatting
You set your initial font and paragraph info in Scrivener > Preferences, (command-comma). My info looks like this:
![][ScreenShot2018-06-15at35655AM]

To change that information, you can click the controls at the top of the paragraph, for example, to show the fonts panel:

![][ScreenShot2018-06-15at35933AM]

I could change the face from Arial if I wanted to. I don’t. I am going to turn off the Show Invisibles, however.
Note in the Formatting window above that the two paragraphs, the quotation and the name, are adjacent. When you’re on that window, you could use Format>Paragraph>Line and Paragraph Spacing to put some inter-paragraph spacing in place. I don’t do that, because Markdown requires explicit blank lines between paragraphs, so making fake ones would just confuse me. If this paragraph confuses you, pretend you didn’t read it.

# Regrets, I’ve had a few #

Regrets, I’ve had a few
Since I mentioned regrets, and since I always do “Programming in Public”, or in this case “Scrivening in Public”, here’s what’s on my mind. I’m going to start creating a few index cards on the cork board, to get a general idea of what might be in this little book. And it becomes clear right away that those ideas will fall into classifications, and some of them could be quite large.
For example, we may have some ideas about compiling to markdown. We may have some discussion about the details of layouts and prefixes and suffixes. We will surely talk about how to split the compiled document into bits, and we will probably do that manually at least once and then write a little script to do it and then embed that script into the Scrivener compilation.
I can imagine that this may mean that this little book will have sections, each section containing chapters, each chapter containing some kind of sub-documents like our current Sub-Sections. Maybe three levels instead of two.
We can change that setup at any time but it always seems best to get it right at the beginning, especially when we don’t know our way around the framework all that well. But I have enough experience with Scrivener to feel sure that we can’t get in too much trouble if we don’t do anything too radical. So we’ll let it ride. I do think I’ll create a folder and then test a compile.
