# After Pascal came Windows and C++ #

The time goes and I had to buy a more modern computer. While the first purchase after my Schneider PC was for a followup school and thus a notebook - it indeed was a sub notebook - one of the first DIN A 5 format notebooks that looked so cute. It still was a MS DOS only machine and I had to go further, I had made a decision to buy into a new tower 386DX40 PC with Windows 3.1 and a whooping 4 MB of RAM. With that PC I also shortly have purchased one of the fastest compilers available at that time - known to be used by Doom - a game. It was Watcom 10.6.

Using that compiler, I learned C++ and Windows programming. I started with simple C API but moved fast into object oriented programming and started using MFC. There I still didnâ€™t started with database programming and repeated my experiences with data structures using MFC and Drawcli as a base for my own application I started to write for a model railroad club that also had activities in riding real steam locomotives and old trains to take those people wanting to sit in old trains getting some coal smoke	 into the face.
