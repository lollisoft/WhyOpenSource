# Trainres and the journey through MFC #

With the new compiler and with some help from some club team mates I wrote a train reservation system - or more, I tried too. There was a stakeholder wanting fancy diagrams of the ride like those maps shown on train stations - in a shrinked down version though. At that time in 16 Bit Windows 3.1 on my 386 DX 40.

Train - A windows application written using MFC

At that time I went far with my knowledge - I thought - and was eager to further develop that application for the club. In the screenshot you see a net list with some red colored lines and one without. The colored ones represent the entry of two train ride plans shown on the right middle screen. The application reacted upon entering that plan with the drawing of the respective tables to start adding ride time schedules below the header. That was the plan.

Also the plan was to use that graphical presentation to store data within. As you see a customer was entered into the bottom left window to have been registered for the train ride 001. All made with data structures and the help of the basics of Drawcli.
