Sections
Next, I’m going to set up my “book” chapter and section information. I have in mind a very simple structure: A document at the top level of Scrivener’s binder, like this one, will be a “chapter”, represented as a single GitHub page. In principle, that would be all you need.
However, Scrivener has this really nice cork board feature, where you can put virtual index cards down, each one representing a document, with the document title, and a synopsis, where you can write on the card what a proposed document will be about. You can see the card for this document in the top right of this picture:

Because I plan to use the cork board to organize this little book, I want to allow for a bit more structure than just documents at the top. I’d like to organize a few cards into a chapter, so my rule will be that a folder at the top level also represents a chapter, and documents inside that folder represent text inside that chapter. So, if a chapter has three ideas in it, there might be three cards representing those ideas, and then each card’s document would have some paragraphs about that idea.
Why do we care? Well, we’re getting ahead of ourselves a bit, but I have learned enough about Scrivener’s compile to think that I’d like my chapters, when compiled, to automatically include the chapter Title from the binder, as their heading. But for ideas within the chapter, I expect not to include the card title, instead leaving the idea transition and any subtitling to manual editing.
I could do all the titling manually, and in the end I may prefer that. But I’m trying to give Scrivener every chance to work for me, so I’m planning to use that much structure.
Let’s talk about how that has to be set up.

# Regrets, I’ve had a few #

Regrets, I’ve had a few
Since I mentioned regrets, and since I always do “Programming in Public”, or in this case “Scrivening in Public”, here’s what’s on my mind. I’m going to start creating a few index cards on the cork board, to get a general idea of what might be in this little book. And it becomes clear right away that those ideas will fall into classifications, and some of them could be quite large.
For example, we may have some ideas about compiling to markdown. We may have some discussion about the details of layouts and prefixes and suffixes. We will surely talk about how to split the compiled document into bits, and we will probably do that manually at least once and then write a little script to do it and then embed that script into the Scrivener compilation.
I can imagine that this may mean that this little book will have sections, each section containing chapters, each chapter containing some kind of sub-documents like our current Sub-Sections. Maybe three levels instead of two.
We can change that setup at any time but it always seems best to get it right at the beginning, especially when we don’t know our way around the framework all that well. But I have enough experience with Scrivener to feel sure that we can’t get in too much trouble if we don’t do anything too radical. So we’ll let it ride. I do think I’ll create a folder and then test a compile.
