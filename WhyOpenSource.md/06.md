# My first model driven ideas #

After learning SAA and modern UI in that days, I learned to know a dialog designer from a book. It should help me in software creation. Quickly I found that I would do more like that and created my own first way to produce software without typing code. TVBuild was my first attempt for a model driven application development environment.

TVBuild - an attempt to produce code by an application that offers me menus and dialogs.
